//
//  Everything real is either in the `SwiftSerpeExtension` target (extension-only
//  membership) or in the `enkerli-swift` package next door. A green test action
//  in Xcode says the host app compiles. The checks that matter are in
//  `Scripts/verify.sh`, which runs outside Xcode for exactly this reason.
//
//  Kept rather than deleted so the absence reads as a decision.
