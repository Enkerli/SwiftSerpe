"""Checks SwiftSerpe's audio component identity.

An AUv3 is identified by the (type, subtype, manufacturer) triple, not by its
name or bundle ID. Two components sharing a triple means the host resolves
*either* name to whichever one it indexed — which is how loading Progression
Studio in AUM launched MelGen once: the Xcode template's default subtype was
"Prst", Progression Studio's code.

That matters more here than anywhere. This plug-in was scaffolded by copying
ProgGenie's project file, which had itself been copied from MelGen's, so it
started life claiming somebody else's triple twice over. It is
`aumi/Srpe/Enke` — deliberately *not* `RPEd`, which belongs to the JUCE Rhythm
Pattern Explorer and would collide with the AUv3 that build already ships. The
two are meant to be installable side by side, which is the only way the trade in
PORTING.md §0 gets tested rather than argued about.

Checks:
  1. The extension's Info.plist and the host app's lookup agree on the triple.
  2. The subtype doesn't collide with any sibling plug-in's PLUGIN_CODE.
  3. The bundle identifier doesn't collide either — a different failure with a
     worse symptom, since the plug-in then does not appear at all.
  4. The display name follows the "Manufacturer: Product" convention hosts
     expect, so AUM shows "SwiftSerpe" rather than a target name.

Siblings are found two ways, because there are two kinds: the JUCE plug-ins
declare PLUGIN_CODE in CMakeLists.txt, and a Swift AUv3 declares its triple in
the extension's Info.plist and has no CMakeLists at all.
